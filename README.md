🛠️ OPERATIONAL STACK
The tools I use to bend silicon to my will.

LAYER	TECHNOLOGIES
Core Engines	Python, C++ (Learning), FastAPI, Flask
Neural/Vision	YOLOv8, MediaPipe, OpenCV, TensorFlow, spaCy
Data Fort	PostgreSQL, Supabase, Redis, VectorDB
Deployment	Docker, GitHub Actions, Linux (Kernel Mastery)
💎 SELECTED_OPERATIONS (Top Projects)
🦾 Gesture Control OS

The Problem: Keyboards are the bottleneck. The Fix: A CV-driven interface with 30+ gesture commands. 60 FPS real-time tracking with <50ms latency. No cloud, just raw local processing.

📧 MailMind

The Problem: AI privacy is a myth. The Fix: Privacy-first email assistant. In-memory processing only. Zero server-side storage. Intelligence without intrusion.
